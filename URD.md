- [UR-02] Users shall be able to list all registered count items to view their current status and details. (Ref: Issue #bdd91e8)
- [UR-03] Users shall be able to update the details (e.g., name, description) of existing count items. (Ref: Issue #bdd91e8)
- [UR-04] Users shall be able to delete registered count items when they are no longer needed. (Ref: Issue #bdd91e8)
